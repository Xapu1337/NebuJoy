# My 3D SpaceMouse project

## I'M A BEGINNER / NEW, SO INSTRUCTIONS OR CODE MIGHT CHANGE
## I want others to tinker with their own solution and the original called for an arduino nano, and I like faster microcontrollers.

Based on (DIY 3D SpaceMouse by TeachingTech)[https://www.printables.com/model/864950-open-source-spacemouse-space-mushroom-remix] from YouTube 

Code has been changed to run on any ESP device capable of USB-OTG (S2, S3)
Using PlatformIO for crossplatform compilation & custom PID & VID 

# BOM
- ESP32 S2 Mini or S3 Mini (1x)
- JST 2.45 Female Headers or crimping tool with JST 2.45 terminals (1x set or 1x tool and enough terminals)
- Joystick Module (4x)
- Butt connectors, Wago connectors, or other suitable wire-to-wire connection method (As needed, minimum 2)
